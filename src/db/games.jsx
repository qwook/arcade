      <p>A puzzle where you utilize the elemental gems of alchemy to try and create as many gold gems as possible.</p>
      <p>Fire: Red, Water:&nbsp;Blue, Air: Purple, Earth: Green</p>
      <p>Gems of opposing force (Fire &gt;&lt; Water, Air&nbsp;&gt;&lt; Earth)&nbsp;will push each other if they're adjacent. If&nbsp;two gems of the same element collides, it creates a Gold Gem. Otherwise, it creates a Black Gem. Gold Gem &amp; Black Gem cannot move, and will absorb all gems when colliding.</p>
      <p><strong>Freeplay</strong>: The goal is to have as many Gold Gems as possible on the board until you can no longer put more gems on.</p>
      <p><strong>Puzzle</strong>: The goal is to create the specified number of Gold Gems. Only Water Gem will spawn.</p>
      <p><strong>PvP</strong>: Same rule as Freeplay, but whenever you create a Black Gem, you also create it in your opponent's board. Black Gems will absorb all but Gold Gems.&nbsp;Whoever created more Gold Gems wins.</p>

      <p>A 2D physics game about a line of baby chicks trying to keep up with their mother hen.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;• The player controls the leading chick. Their objective is to balance it while it walks, via the left and right mouse.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>• The longer they walk, the faster the game becomes.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>• Their progress is recorded through a km distance display</p>
      <p>• If they fall down, they must quickly stand back up again by pressing Z. The player cannot spam Z as it has its own cooldown, and must avoid falling too many times within short intervals.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>• If the mother hen gets too far away from them, they lose.</p>
