    <p>Play through games made by students at RMIT Vietnam on an old internet coffee shop setup!</p>
    <Lag><p>This installation is meant to connect the past and future of video-games together. Internet Coffee Shops (or Quan Net) were the main platforms for many youths growing up in the 90's and early 2000's to play free online video-games and socialize. These online games were mainly imported from other countries and made available through Vietnamese publishers such as ZingMe. This installation imagines an alternate universe where the online games people played were instead made by Vietnamese developers.</p></Lag>
    <p><strong>Gank</strong> is a MOBA gaming term that meant "to be ambushed" by the enemy team. The phrase "me gank" would be used to describe students who would be ambushed by their mother at an Internet Coffee Shop, probably because they're skipping class.</p>
